For plotting the figures, just put the series of plot_curve_q*.py in the root dir of the data folder and make a new images folder in the root dir, and run python command. The results would be stored in the images folder.

```
# chdir into the root dir of the data folder
os.makedir('images')
python plot_curve_q1.py
python plot_curve_q2.py
...
```
